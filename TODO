NVasquez:

1) Handle the case when no defects are found. Every atom should be selected, right?

2) If there is only one Kpoint, the atomic mode should be set by default. Search for 'NKPTS =     61'

3) Look for spin, if it is spinful (ISPIN  =      2 ), set cmap='seismic', vmax=1.0, vmin=-1.0

4) orbitals, default = s+p+d

FMunoz:

1) add some tests for plot_bands.py
